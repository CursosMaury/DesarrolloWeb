    <title>Birth of a standard: The Intel 8086</title>

        <h1>History of Intel 8086</h1>
        introducing the x86 architecture that underlies every PC—Windows, Mac, or Linux—produced today
        <p>Forty years ago, Intel released the 8086 processor</p>

    <strong>
        The release of Intel’s 8086 microprocessor in 1978 was a watershed moment for personal computing. 
        The DNA of that chip is likely at the center of whatever computer—Windows, Mac, 
        or Linux—you’re using to read this, and it helped transform Intel from merely one of 
        many chip companies to the world’s largest.

        What’s most surprising about the tremendous success of the 8086, though, 
        is how little people expected of it when it was first conceived. The history of 
        this revolutionary processor is a classic tale of how much a small team of bright 
        engineers can accomplish when they’re given the freedom to do their jobs in 
        innovative ways.

            Intel’s 8086 microprocessor spawned the x86 standard for personal computers

            When development of the 8086 began in May 1976, Intel executives never imagined 
            its spectacular impact. They saw it as a minor stopgap project. They were pinning 
            the company’s hopes on a radically different and more sophisticated processor 
            called the 8800 (later released as the iAPX 432). In an era when most chips 
            still used 8-bit data paths, the 8800 would leapfrog all the way up to 32 bits. 
            Its advanced multitasking capabilities and memory-management circuitry would 
            be built right into the CPU, allowing operating systems to run with much less 
            program code.

        But the 8800 project was in trouble. It had encountered numerous delays 
        as Intel engineers found that the complex design was difficult to implement 
        with then-current chip technology. And Intel’s problems didn’t stop there—it
        was being outflanked by Zilog, a company started by former Intel engineers. 
        Zilog had quickly captured the midrange microprocessor market with its Z80 CPU. 
        Released in July 1976, it was an enhanced clone of Intel’s successful 
        8080—the processor that had effectively launched the personal-computer 
        revolution. Intel had yet to come up with an answer to the Z80.
